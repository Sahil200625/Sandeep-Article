Here are some things to consider when using social media:

Who you talk to
Be aware of who you interact with on social media.

Security risks
Be aware of the security risks associated with social media, such as malware, social engineering attacks, account hijacking, clickbait, and scams.

Employer considerations
Employers may look at your social media presence when considering you for a job.

Social media awareness can also refer to a marketing strategy used to increase brand awareness. Social media awareness campaigns can be a cost-effective way to reach a large audience and build trust with customers.

<p> Self-awareness is the ability to focus on yourself and how your actions, thoughts, or emotions do or don't align with your internal standards. In philosophy of self, self-awareness is the experience of one's own personality or individuality. It is not to be confused with consciousness in the sense of qualia. While consciousness is being aware of one's body and environment, self-awareness is the recognition of that consciousness. </p>
